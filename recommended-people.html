                <h3>My Role</h3>
                    <p>
                    As a solo designer, I conducted:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Competitive analysis</li>
                        <li>User interviews</li>
                        <li>User journeys</li>
                        <li>Site mapping</li>
                        <li>Wireframes</li>
                        <li>Low-High prototype</li>
                        <li>User testing</li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>
                <br>
            <h3>THE PROBLEM</h3>
            <p> 
                New homeowners often have no way other than to find builders online due not knowing the builders in their area.
                Homeowners often have issues communicating smoothly with builders.
                For example, they would not get a reply from the builder after sending a message, or the builder became aggressive about payment afterwards.    
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>UX GOAL</h3>
            <p> 
                To create an app that support various communication methods between homeowners and builders. The app also should allow both parties to manage their jobs, so that there is a mutual understanding on the progress, schedule and payment.   
            </p>  
            <br>  
            <h3>TARGET AUDIENCE</h3>
            <p> 
                <ul>
                    <li>Age range 30-50</li>
                    <li>Homeowners with no contacts with a builder</li>
                </ul>
            </p> 
            <br>   
            <h3>USER RESEARCH - COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS</h3>
            <p> 
                I conducted competitive analysis on five other competitor websites in which two of them were in depth analysis. I carried out in depth marketing, strategy, SWOT and UX analysis. The competitive analysis uncovered that most of the similar apps had features to automatically match the right builders for homeowners depending on their needs. However, they lacked support for ongoing jobs after the builder was matched.   
            </p>  
            <br>   
            <h3>USER RESEARCH - USER INTERVIEWS</h3>
            <p> 
                Interviews were conducted with three homeowners and one professional builder, all in person. All homeowners had recently bought their home and had experience in finding a builder for their home refurbishment.
                I constructed the interview questions in order to find out the issues and concerns homeowners had when hiring a builder.

            <h3>USER JOURNEYS AND USER FLOWS</h3>
            <p> 
                I created three user personas and their scenarios for each journey and flow. These steps helped me clarify each step that the users would take to complete their tasks, and understand the potential opportunities and emotions that users would be going through.

            <h3>SITE MAPPING</h3>
            <p> 
                Card sorting determined three main areas for the app as ‘Dashboard’, ‘How to use’ and ‘Builders’ page. Once wireframes were created, site mapping was revised and updated where necessary.
            </p>    
            <br> 
            <h3>SKETCHES TO WIREFRAMES</h3>
            <p> 
                Based on user flows and site mapping, I made some initial sketches with pen and paper to ideate the core function and modals.
                I then created a mid-fidelity prototype to determine each page in detail.

            <h3>IN-PERSON MODERATED TESTS</h3>
            <p> 
                The goal of the test is to measure the app’s usability. I assessed this by how easy the participants found it to complete basic tasks.
                After affinity mapping and rainbow sheet analysis, the test uncovered 5 major issues in the app.
            </p>    
            <br> 
            <h3>A/B PREFERENCE TESTING</h3>
            <p> 
                Usability testing also revealed that the users had issues with fining the builder’s previous works. I conducted A/B Preference test to check which version best allows the users to find the previous work of this builder.
            </p>    
            <br> 
            <h3>EXPECTED OUTCOME & CONCLUSION</h3>
            <p> 
                <ol>
                    <li>Most homeowners get a reply from builders due to recorded communication. No more being ignored!</li>
                    <li>Smooth payment transaction due to in-advance-payment instruction from the builder</li>                
                    <li>Less mis-communication between the homeowners and builders for scheduling, process and payments</li>                
                </ol>
            </p>    
            <br> 
            <h3>WHAT I LEARNT</h3>
            <p> 
                The app was well received by the users and they gave positive comments on its simplicity and clean design.
                I found it challenging to construct the right questions for user research and user testing, especially as it was extremely important to gain the right insights but I enjoyed designing and iterating from the information I gathered. It was a joy to see it all come together. There are many more improvements, but also countless opportunities for this app.
